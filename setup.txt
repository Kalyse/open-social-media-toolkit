* APACHE: Configure your website in Apache using /sites/default/apache_conf_sample as a guide
  - e.g. we are using default.newsi.us in our example pages

* CONSTANTS: Copy /sites/default/constants_sample.php to /sites/default/constants.php and edit settings to your environment

* DATABASE: Create a database and set permissions
  - e.g. CREATE DATABASE menagerie; 
  - e.g. GRANT ALL ON menagerie.* TO 'your_mysql_name'@'your_client_host';

* FACEBOOK: Create a Facebook application 
  - Use the http://www.facebook.com/developers/ application to set up a new application. You just need to select a name at this time. Other settings will be uploaded during our installation process.
  - Alternately, you can use the Facebook Connect Wizard http://developers.facebook.com/setup.php
  - make note of the application id and secret keys for the .ini file you set up below

* INI File: Copy /sites/default/default_sample.ini to ../default.ini on your web server (usually one directory below the site web files)
  - note: you can also choose not to use a .ini file, but statically set them in your constants.php file
  - include your Facebook application id and keys
  - make sure the database, username, password & host is in your ini file 

* CONFIGURATION: Visit the configuration menu
  - The basic domain should work http://default.newsi.us
  - but also http://default.newsi.us/?p=config
  - and once security is turned on, you'll need an apiKey e.g. http://default.newsi.us/?p=config&apiKey=999-default
  - note: 999-default is our example apiKey, replace this argument with what you used in your .ini file

  - Follow the configuration menu options
      	> Initialize the database
		> Populate test data
		> Upload your application settings to Facebook
		> Visit your application on Facebook e.g. http://apps.facebook.com/defaultapp
		> Visit the management console
		> Remove test data
		> Configure and turn on security, caching and logging as described
		> Add your site to our public gallery http://support.newscloud.com/discussions/site-gallery 

* CRON: When ready, copy the /sites/default/cron_sample file to your cron directory and edit settings
