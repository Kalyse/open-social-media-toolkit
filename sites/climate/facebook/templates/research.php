	$this->addTemplate('aboutResearch','<div><p>Today, the Internet is changing how we locate, learn from, and share up-to-date information. All over the world sectors like journalism, education, business, and politics, are working to re-invent themselves in ways that tap the immense people-power of the Internet. The Youth and Social Media study being conducted by researchers from the University of Minnesota in partnership with NewsCloud is working to define how new Web technologies -- like this Hot Dish Facebook application -- can engage people with important issues and world events, build community, and generate real world impact.</p><p style="clear:both;">As part of this research effort, we will be inviting you as users to share your ideas in short surveys and focus groups. We will also be behind-the-scenes, exploring how people use Hot Dish’s features and which features seem most useful and engaging. By using Hot Dish you will help us to advance our collective understanding of how to better engage young people in online information; how to increase our information and digital literacy practices; how to build online communities; and how to use the Internet to deliver educational materials in innovative ways.</p><p>For more information, please visit our <a href="http://www.newscloud.com/research" target="_blank">research web site</a>.</p></div>');
