Current Release Notes - Jun 9, 2009
----------------------------------------
The Facebook release provides the code needed for running Facebook applications similar to Hot Dish and MnDaily (this code does not provide code running NewsCloud.com). Please share your feedback at our Google Groups developer forum below and we will try to integrate documentation and configuration improvements for our beta release at the end of May. 

Please read the setup.txt document in the /docs folder in order to set up and configure your application and its synchronization with the NewsCloud.com API services.

NOTE: This is a complex and sophisticated infrastructure for powering social media news communities. Managing this system requires advanced system administration and Web development expertise. If you are interested in learning about NewsCloud's managed service and consulting services, please visit: http://blog.newscloud.com/services.html 

We encourage you to sign up for our developer forum at Google Groups. Please submit all feedback and questions to the developer community there:
